iOS static library for World Weather Online API

### Usage

Check for a very simple implementation the "WorldWeatherOnline-test" project. 

### Building the library

Building a new static library after making changes is as easy as calling the build.sh script in the root of the repo. It will generate a directory with the header file and a library which can be used in the simulator as well on a device.
